LOLTest
=======

It's a Android app that tests your knowledge of the most popular online game League of Legends.

Installation
============

If you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will need to download
champion data from http://lol.qq.com/101/hero.shtml and item data from
http://lol.duowan.com/s/items.html. From the top directory, do:

    cd scripts
    ./crawl.sh

Once the data are downloaded, LOLTest can be compiled using ADT.
